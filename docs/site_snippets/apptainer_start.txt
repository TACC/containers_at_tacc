Start an Interactive Session
================================

The Apptainer module is currently only available on compute nodes at |site|. To use Apptainer interactively, start an interactive session on a compute node using the |interactivecmd| command.

.. code-block:: console

	qrsh -l h_rt=00:10:00 -now no

Once the command runs successfully, you will no longer be on a login node, but instead have a shell on an allocated compute node.
