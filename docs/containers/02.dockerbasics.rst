Terminlogies in the Docker world
================================

**Containers**

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its
dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Containers includes everything from the
operating system, user-added files, metadata.

Containers are very useful as they are available for both Linux and Windows-based applications, containerized software
will run the same, irrespective of the infrastructure. They isolate the software from the environment, facilitating users to overcome
conflicts between local development environments and execution environment.

Running an image creates a Docker Container.
They feature a read-write layer on top, are interactive and can store state. This means that once you execute inside a Docker container,
you can save a snapshot of the resulting state as another image.

**Images**

A Docker image is a read-only file used to produce Docker containers.
It is comprised of layers of other images, any change made to an image is carried out by adding a new layer.

Base Image is the layer that does not depend on any other layer. For example most of the time this layer defines the operating system
for the docker container's environment.

An image gets built by building a Dockerfile.

... which brings us to

**What is a Dockerfile?**

Dockerfiles are text files you create with the commands you would like to execute on the command line inside a container to
create a Docker image. Docker reads the commands from top to bottom and builds a Docker image from it.

Dockerfiles are useful as they contain the history of the procedure used to create an image. They can be used to install required dependencies,
tools, tool-related files into the docker container.

Some best practices for writing Dockerfiles can be found at: `Best Practices <https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/>`_.

With a Dockerfile in hand, we can build an image from it by

.. code-block:: bash

   $ docker build .

**Image Registry**

We can store the docker images we create in image registries. Registries are organized into collections of images called *repositories*.

`Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/>`_ is a central, public repository of images.

Getting Started With Docker
===========================

Prerequisites:
--------------

- Install Docker on your laptop:

  - `Mac <https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/docker-for-mac/install>`_
  - `Windows 10 <https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/docker-for-windows/install/>`_
  - `Ubuntu <https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/>`_
  - `CentOS <https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/installation/linux/centos/>`_
  - `Debian <https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/debian/>`_
  - `Fedora <https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/fedora/>`_

To check if the installation was successful, open up your favourite Terminal (Mac,Linux), or the Docker Terminal (Windows)
and try running

.. code-block:: bash

   $ docker version
   # show version information

* Create a `Docker Hub account <https://hub.docker.com/signup/>`_

Having a Docker Hub account makes it easier to share your containers with other researchers.

Let's login into Docker Hub to be able to push images to your repository.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ docker login
   # Enter username/password

* Create a `TACC Account <https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/account-request>`_


Working with Docker Hub images
==============================

Say *hello* from Docker

Let's run a simple hello-world container using the * docker run * command

.. code-block:: bash

   $ docker run hello-world
   Hello from Docker!
   This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

This simple command pulls the hello-world image from Docker Hub and prints the message.

You could also try:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ docker inspect hello-world
   # more information about container image

.. code-block:: bash

   $ docker --help
   # show all docker options and summaries

.. code-block:: bash

   $ docker COMMAND --help
   # show options and summaries for a particular command
