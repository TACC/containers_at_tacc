Containers on High Performance Compute Clusters
===============================================

High performance computing (HPC) systems serve a large role in academic computing at scale.  In this portion of the training, we will explore methods for running containers that you develop on HPC systems and also discovering containers built by the community that you can utilize.

**Objectives for this session**

  * Use Apptainer to execute Docker containers on a HPC system
  * Create a container that can use the Message Passing Interface (MPI) to use multiple nodes in parallel
  * Understand how to run containers that use GPUs for computation
  * Discover community curated software containers available at |site|
