Containerize Your Code
======================

*Scenario:* You are a researcher who has developed a novel chunk of code. You 
now want to distribute this code for others to use in what you know to be a
stable production environment (including OS and dependency verions). End users
may want to use this code on their local workstations or on an HPC cluster.

In this section, we will build a container from scratch with some sample python
code (provided). Please feel free to substitute in one of your own favorite
programs or projects you are working on.
