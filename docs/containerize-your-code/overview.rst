Containerize Your Code
======================

*Scenario:* You are a researcher who has developed some new code for a
scientific application. You now want to distribute that code for others to use
in what you know to be a stable production environment (including OS and
dependency versions). End users may want to use this code on their local
workstations or on an HPC cluster.

In this section, we will build a container from scratch with some sample python
code (provided). Please feel free to substitute in one of your own favorite
programs or projects you are working on.
